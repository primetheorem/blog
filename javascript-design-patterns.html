<h3>Module Pattern</h3>
The module pattern depends on immediately-invoked function expression, or shortly IIFE, which is a well-known idiom in the JavaScript world.

<div>
(function () {
    // Code goes here
})();
</div>

The main idea of using IIFE is to retain privacy for the variables and the functions inside of it and prevent polluting the global environment (global variables are a source of bugs and confusion and should be avoided).
